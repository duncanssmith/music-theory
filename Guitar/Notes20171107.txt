Pedal note:

If you're playing a harmonised scale of Dmajor, the pedal note is A

So:

I    ii    iii    IV    V    vi    vii 
D    E-    F#-    G     A    B     C#o



The pedal note is the 5th (dominant) of the scale, and will work harmonically with 
any of the 7 harmonised chords, and can be played together with any of the notes 
from any of the chords in the scale

Sequence in Db:

  I      ii    iii   IV     V      vi     vii
  Db     Eb-   F-    Gb     Ab     Bb-    Co
