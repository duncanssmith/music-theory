Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain

Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain.

The dark days are done and the bright days are here, my sunny one shines so sincere,

Sunny, one so true, I love you.


Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet,
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way.
You gave to me your one and all,
and now I feel ten feet tall. Sunny, one so true, I love you.


Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see,
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z.
My life was torn like-a windblown sand, then
a rock was formed when we held hands, Sunny, one so true, I love you.


Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face,
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows from grace.
You're my spark of nature's fire,
you're my sweet complete desire, Sunny, one so true, I love you.


I love you I love you
